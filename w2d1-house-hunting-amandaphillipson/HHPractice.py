## Calculate how many months to save downpayment for a home, based on:
## annual salary, total cost, and current/monthly savings.
## annual_salary = 120000
## total_cost = 1000000


# print("Enter your annual income:")

# if input > 0 = annual_salary

# print("Enter price of home:)

# if input > 0 = total_cost


# portion_down_payment = total_cost * 0.25
# portion_saved = annual_salary * 0.10
# current_savings = 0
# month = 0
# r = (portion_saved / 12) * (0.04 / 12)
# current_savings = current_savings (current_savings * (r /12))

# while current_savings < portion_down_payment:
#     current_savings = current_savings + (current_savings * (r / 12)) + portion_saved
    
#     month = month + 1
    
#     print(month)


## Finally able to run a basic loop!  However, the math is incorrect.  
## Also, I do not yet understand how to allow a user to enter input that will run the code. Perhaps a boolean situation? 
## More time needed to learn and problem-solve.
